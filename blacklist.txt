# Tempest and its plugins are branchless which means master version of these
# tools are used in testing the master + stable branches (except EM stable branch
# where we pin the Tempest and plugins for testing). Keeping Tempest in the
# u-c file will block testing the master + stable branches with Tempest master.
# Bug#1916771 for more details.
# Once any stable branch move to 'Extended Maintenance' and we pin the
# older Tempest to test them then we can move it from here to u-c file.
